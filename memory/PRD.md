# Fidelis Logic - IT Consulting Website

## Original Problem Statement
Build a modern, enterprise-grade IT consulting website, "Fidelis Logic", targeting Enterprise IT Directors and CXOs with:
- Professional website with Home, About, Blog, Contact, and service pages
- Email submission for contact forms
- Microsoft Bookings integration for scheduling consultations
- Blog section with full admin panel for dynamic content management (text, images, videos)

- Confident, consultative tone with design elements from reference website

## User Personas
1. **IT Directors/Managers** - Decision-makers for workplace technology consulting
2. **Operations Managers** - Solutions for meeting rooms, collaboration, workspace optimization
3. **SMB Owners/CEOs** - Business applications (ERP/HRMS/CRM) implementation
4. **Procurement Teams** - Vendor-neutral guidance on technology investments

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** React 19, React Router v7, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, TipTap (rich text editor)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python), Motor (async MongoDB driver)
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Authentication:** JWT for admin panel

### Phase 5: Smart Deals + CMS Split (Completed - December 2025)
- Smart Deals CMS branch (Blogs vs Deals admin split)
- Deals CRUD with start/end date auto-expiry logic
- Public Deals listing + detail pages
- Enhanced TipTap editor (colors, alignment, tables, task lists, video/image embed)

### Phase 6: SEO & Backlog Cleanup (Completed - December 19, 2025)
**Blog Content Migration**
- Seeded 6 legacy blog posts from former `mock.js` into MongoDB (idempotent script at `/app/backend/scripts/seed_legacy_blog_posts.py`)
- Renamed `mock.js` → `siteContent.js` (content clarity, removed `blogPosts` export)
- Deleted `mock.js`; updated all 9 import sites

**Dynamic Sitemap**
- New `GET /api/sitemap.xml` returning `application/xml` with static pages + all published blog posts + active non-expired deals
- Added `SITE_BASE_URL` env var in `backend/.env` (default `https://www.fidelislogic.com`)
- Removed static `public/sitemap.xml`; updated `robots.txt` to reference `/api/sitemap.xml`

**FAQ Schema + Visible FAQ Sections**
- New `FAQSection.jsx` accordion component (reusable)
- Expanded FAQ content (5–6 Q&A) for MeetingRooms, Headsets, WorkspaceExperience, BusinessApps
- Each service page now renders visible `<FAQSection>` + JSON-LD `<FAQSchema>` (FAQPage structured data)

**Breadcrumb Navigation**
- New `Breadcrumbs.jsx` component with visible UI + `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD
- Added to: Solutions, Meeting Rooms, Headsets, Workspace, Business Apps, About, Blog, BlogPost, Smart Deals, DealPost, Contact

### Phase 7: Brand Ecosystem + Floating Smart Deals + GA4 (Completed - February 5, 2026)
**Brand Ecosystem (Information Architecture redesign)**
- New top-nav entry: "Brands" (between Solutions and About)
- New `/brands` hub page (`Brands.jsx`) with hero, Featured Partners (ROOMZ, Morbit), full brand grid, "Advisor not reseller" positioning, footer CTA
- New `/brands/:slug` detail pages (`BrandDetail.jsx`) for ROOMZ, Morbit, Jabra, Poly, Neat, Yealink, Logitech — each with hero, At-a-Glance panel, strengths grid, products, use cases, Fidelis delivery wrap, related brands, lead-gen CTA
- Brand data model in `/app/frontend/src/data/brands.js` (single source of truth)
- `TrustedBrands.jsx` reusable section (compact + detailed variants); rendered on Home (compact) and About (detailed Partner Ecosystem)
- `SolutionBrands.jsx` inline section on solution pages — Workspace Experience → ROOMZ/Morbit; Meeting Rooms → Poly/Neat/Logitech/Yealink; Headsets → Jabra/Poly/Logitech
- Sitemap (`/api/sitemap.xml`) updated with `/brands` (priority 0.9) and all 7 brand detail URLs (0.8 for featured, 0.7 for others)

**Partnership Type Badges**
- New reusable `PartnershipBadge.jsx` component with two visual tiers:
  - **Distribution Partner** (ROOMZ): solid amber-600 fill, white text, award icon, ring-1 amber-700/20 shadow — communicates top-tier commercial commitment
  - **Channel Partner** (Morbit, Jabra, Poly, Neat, Yealink, Logitech): clean white pill, slate border, slate-700 text, small amber-500 leading dot — refined authorized tier
- Badges surfaced everywhere a brand is shown: Brands hub (featured + grid cards), brand detail (hero + At-a-glance + related brands), TrustedBrands compact/detailed, SolutionBrands cards

**Floating Smart Deals Button**
- "Smart Deals" removed from main nav; now `FloatingDealsButton.jsx` FAB in bottom-right of every public page
- Hidden on `/admin/*` and `/deals` routes; dismissible per-session via sessionStorage
- New `GET /api/deals/active` endpoint (returns published, non-expired deals as `[]` when empty — fixes prior 404)
- FAB renders independent of deal count (count only drives the badge bubble)

**Google Analytics (GA4)**
- Google tag `G-EEXXM8VHSC` installed in `frontend/public/index.html` immediately after `<head>` element
- Single tag, served once on the SPA shell — applies to every route (Home, /brands, /brands/:slug, etc.)
- Verified: `window.dataLayer` initialized, `window.gtag` function active, persists across SPA navigation

**Brand Logo Placeholders (Phase 7.3 — Feb 8, 2026)**
- New `components/BrandLogo.jsx` centralised renderer with graceful wordmark fallback (handles missing files / load errors without breaking the UI)
- `logoImage` field added to each brand in `brands.js` pointing to `/brand-logos/<slug>.svg`
- Generic SVG placeholders created at `/app/frontend/public/brand-logos/{roomz,morbit,jabra,poly,neat,yealink,logitech}.svg` — clearly labelled "LOGO PLACEHOLDER" using generic system fonts; user will replace with supplier-approved logos
- All wordmark text usages replaced site-wide: Brands hub (featured + grid), BrandDetail (hero + related), TrustedBrands (compact + detailed), SolutionBrands cards
- To swap: drop replacement file at the same path/filename, or change `logoImage` to `.png` if needed

**Cookie Consent + Conditional GA4 Loading (Phase 7.2 — Feb 7, 2026)**
- New `lib/cookieConsent.js` helper + `components/CookieConsent.jsx` banner
- GA4 (`gtag.js`) NO LONGER auto-loads from `index.html`. Only a tiny `dataLayer` + `gtag` stub is initialised at boot so analytics calls don't error pre-consent
- Banner appears on first visit (bottom-left card with Accept / Decline)
- Accept → `gtag.js` script dynamically injected, choice persisted as `granted` in localStorage
- Decline → choice persisted as `denied`, GA script never loads
- On subsequent visits, prior choice is honoured silently (no re-prompt)
- Verified end-to-end: pre-consent state has no GA script in DOM; post-accept GA loads and persists across reloads; localStorage records `granted` / `denied`

**GA4 Conversion Event Tracking (Phase 7.1 — Feb 7, 2026)**
- New `/app/frontend/src/lib/analytics.js` thin gtag wrapper (safely no-ops if blocked or pre-consent)
- Events tracked across high-intent CTAs:
  - `consultation_cta_click` — Header (desktop + mobile), Home hero, Home footer CTA, Brand-detail hero CTA. Params: `location`, `source_path`, `brand` (when applicable)
  - `partner_briefing_click` — `/brands` hub hero + footer CTAs. Params: `location`
  - `brand_lead_start` — fires on first keystroke in any BrandLeadForm. Params: `brand`, `variant` (compact/full)
  - `brand_lead_submit` — fires on successful brand lead submission. Params: `brand`, `brand_name`, `variant`, `partnership_type`
  - `brand_lead_submit_error` — fires on submission failure. Params: `brand`, `variant`, `error`
  - `contact_form_submit` — fires on `/contact` page form success. Params: `topic`
  - `floating_deals_click` — fires on Smart Deals FAB click. Params: `active_count`, `source_path`
  - `solution_brand_click` — fires on solution-page brand card click. Params: `brand`, `brand_name`, `solution`
- Verified live in browser via `window.gtag` wrapping — events fire with correct names and params
- New `/app/frontend/src/lib/analytics.js` thin gtag wrapper (safely no-ops if blocked)

- Verified live in browser via `window.gtag` wrapping — events fire with correct names and params

**SEO Robustness**
- `meta name="robots" content="index, follow"` emitted via SEO component on every page
- `robots.txt` permits Googlebot, Bingbot, Applebot, GPTBot, ChatGPT-User, anthropic-ai, Claude-Web, PerplexityBot, CCBot
- All existing live URLs preserved; no redirects required (only new routes added)

## Latest Additions — Feb 2026
### SEO Pre-render Endpoint
- **New module:** `/app/backend/seo_prerender.py`
- **New endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/prerender?path=<route>` — returns full HTML with route-specific `<title>`, meta description, canonical, OG tags, JSON-LD schemas, `<h1>` and summary paragraph baked in. `text/html; charset=utf-8`.
  - `GET /api/prerender/routes` — lists all static + dynamic (published blog) covered routes.
- **Covered routes:** `/`, `/solutions`, `/solutions/business-apps`, `/brands/roomz`, `/blog`, and every published `/blog/<slug>`.
- **Docs:** `/app/deploy/SEO_PRERENDER.md` — nginx and Cloudflare Worker snippets for routing bot User-Agents through this endpoint at the edge.
- **Regression test:** `/app/backend/tests/test_seo_prerender.py` (created by testing agent).
- **Frontend:** unchanged.

### Deployment Playbook (Ubuntu 24.04 + Lightsail + Atlas)
- `/app/deploy/DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` — end-to-end walkthrough with per-dependency install/verify steps.
- `/app/deploy/LOCAL_DEV_SETUP.md` — MacBook local dev.
- `/app/deploy/bootstrap.sh` — one-shot server bootstrap script.
- `/app/deploy/nginx.conf`, `supervisor.conf`, `backend.env.example`, `frontend.env.example`
- `/app/backend/requirements-prod.txt` — trimmed production deps (~15 packages vs 120+ in requirements.txt).
- `/app/.github/workflows/deploy.yml` + `deploy-backend.yml` — CI/CD.

### P0 Regressions Fixed
- `AdminFAQDashboard.jsx` — restored missing `import { services } from "../data/services"` (page was throwing ReferenceError on mount).
- `BusinessApps.jsx` — added 4 missing local const arrays (`valueCards`, `aiFeatures`, `deploymentOptions`, `seoHighlights`), destructured `painPoints` and `offer` from `businessAppsDetails`, imported `LucideIcons` namespace.
- `RichTextEditor.jsx` — removed dead `import axios from 'axios'`.
- `Contact.jsx` — fixed nested `<p>` inside `<p>` hydration warning; now a proper `<ul><li>` block.

### Dependency pins (frontend)
`resolutions` block in `package.json` pins:
- `babel-loader@8.4.1`
